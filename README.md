#### Re:Gear
I'm currently working on the inventory management system for Re:Gear Hardware Library Ōtepoti, which is a repo you won't see displayed here... For now! With funding from the Dunedin waste minimalisation fund we are working to achieve a website where the public can request to borrow/claim repurposed hardware, music gear & parts.

#### Other Repos
- 🤌 intellChef is an app made with Suwon Jeong and Ben Velasco @ DevAcademy that uses the ChatGPT API to produce recipes based on what you have in your kitchen.

- 🧑‍🍳 menuMaster is a CRUD app for the storage of master recipes for use in food services. You can update and maintain current recipes so staff members are up to date on how to make items on the menu.
