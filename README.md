#### Re:Gear
I'm currently working on the inventory management system for Re:Gear Hardware Library Ōtepoti, which is a repo you won't see displayed here... For now! With funding from the Dunedin waste minimalisation fund we are working to achieve a website where the public can request to borrow/claim repurposed hardware, music gear & parts.

#### Other Repos
